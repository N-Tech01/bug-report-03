## Overview

Hello,

My name is Navarath, and I would like to bring a potential security issue to your attention. I discovered this issue while using tools like Censys, Shodan, and Nmap, as part of my learning in basic ethical hacking at CADD Centre. I am currently studying in the 8th standard.

## Description of the Issue

While scanning the Parent Portal website of my school, I identified a vulnerability (MS15-034, CVE-2015-1635). You can verify the details of this vulnerability at the following link:
- [Shodan Link](https://www.shodan.io/host/103.114.210.53)

This vulnerability could potentially allow to down the server, and I wanted to bring it to your attention. I also used Metasploit to search for related payloads and confirmed the impact of this issue.This is my fourth bug report, and I hope my contribution will help strengthen the security of the website.
